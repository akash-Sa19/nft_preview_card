### What I learned

This was my first ever project, and it was diffcult for me. I deleted my CSS file three times before getting the right properties and method. After 4 hours of non-stop trying I finally completed this challenge. I learned about CSS flex properties and it is really usefull properties.

### Continued development

I will continue learning CSS and Bootstrap, their so much to learn in web development that one can't say that he/she knows all.
